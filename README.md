# nix-config

My personal configurations for all things laptops/development environments/etc.
Both for my NixOS machines, or Macbooks.

## Contributions

Hmm... do you really want to contribute to my personal configuration? ðŸ¤¨

I mean, if you see something that can be improved and wanna open a PR, I appreciate it!
